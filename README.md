Automatic and optimized calculation of critical plane parameters by means of a semi-analytical formulation.

The mathematical procedure is described in the article:

Bug reports and suggestions are welcome! 
This software is regularly maintained.

Contact me at andrea.chiocca@unipi.it if you need assistance or you need to implement a specific critical plane model within the code.
